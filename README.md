# C3

An extension for HMAX, C3 units are binary classifiers trained on a particular
semantic concept. Passing C2 activations from the same patch set as that used to
train a C3 unit thus tells us how much the object in the image represents the
category on which the C3 unit was trained. They transform shape into semantics.

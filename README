README for 'c3'
===============

An extension for HMAX, C3 units are binary classifiers trained on a particular
semantic concept. Passing C2 activations from the same patch set as that used to
train a C3 unit thus tells us how much the object in the image represents the
category on which the C3 unit was trained. We are learning to transform shape
into semantics.

  - c3Evaluation.m: Perform a series of performance evaluations on the C2 and C3
    activations generated during a full C3 simulation. All data is written to
    files in 'outDir'.

  - c3Simulation.m:  Given a set of parameters, load up a set of C2 responses
    for testing and training, use the training matrix to generate a set of C3
    classifiers, and use those C3 classifiers to generate C3 activations for the
    C2 test data.  Save all data to disk.

  - prepareC3.m: Create the testing/training split data for a C3 simulation

  - README: this file

  - testC3.m: Generate HMAX C3 responses

  - trainC3.m: Generate classifiers to act as HMAX C3 units
